Run a BFS in T from u to v to detect the edge with maximum value in that path. (O(|V|))
If that edge's weight is greater than the weight of the edge you're trying to add
remove that old edge and add the new one.
Otherwise, do nothing, because the new edge would not improve the MST. (O(1)).

The rationale behind this solution is that simply adding the edge into T would create exactly one cycle,
and to restore the MST property you have to remove the edge with maximum value from that cycle.
